This game is similar the original game 'Flappy bird' where your main objective is to dodge barriers to get as far as you can but the only difference is that there actually is a destination. My inspiration for this is that it gives me nostalgic memories from the days when games were much simpler.

GAME IS OPTIMIZED FOR MAC, NOT WINDOWS. FULLY TESTED BOTH PLATFORMS AND THE VALUES ARE ODDLY MUCH MORE SENSITIVE ON WINDOWS (GRAVITY IS TOO STRONG, CHARACTER MOVES TOO FAST, OVERALL UNPLAYABLE)
